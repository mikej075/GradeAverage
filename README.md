# GradeAverage
Simple Java grade average Program

This project asks for a users First, and Last name 
After asking for user information, we ask for three project grades and two Test grades 

After user provides specefied information, the application averages Project, Test and Class percentage.

The Calculations for Project percentage are additions of three project grades divided by 200 * 100

Test percentages are (TestGrade1 + TestGrade2) / 200 * 100

Class percentage is (ProjectPercentage*.40 + TestPercentage*.60)(ProjectPercentage*.40 + TestPercentage*.60)
